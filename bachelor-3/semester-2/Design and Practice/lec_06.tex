We know the system has no poles in the RHP. From the Nyquist plot there is no clockwise encirclement of the point -1 on the real axis. Hence we know that the number of zeros on the RHP is equal to 0, which implies that the system is BIBO stable.

\section{System 2}

For system \#2, the crossover frequency is 3.19 rad/s. The lower and upper gain margins don't exist.

The gain crossover freq for sys 2 is 1.83 rads/s

The upper phase margin is -18 degrees. The lower phase margin does not exist.

We found the K value required is for K to be greater than 1. Since the transfer function has a pole in the RHP, we need one counterclockwise encirclement of the point -1 for the system to be BIBO stable. 

\section{System 3}

K must be less than 2 for BIBO stability. The 180 degree crossover occurs at 1 rad/s. The gain margins do not exist since the calculated frequencies contain imaginary parts.
