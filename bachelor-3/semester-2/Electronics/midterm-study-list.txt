Midterm will be on the Monday after reading week (Feb. 24th) during your tutorial session.

Preparation materials are listed as follows:

1- Lecture slides (please go over all the slides in the MP's Lecture Slide folder)

2- There will be three questions from:

     I. Semiconductors, particularly from Section 3.3 (Current Flow in Semiconductors), Section 3.4 (The pn Junction).

     II.  Diodes, particularly from Section 4.1 (The Ideal Diodes), 4.2 (Terminal Characteristics of Junction Diodes), 4.3 (Modeling the Diode), 4.4 (The Small-Signal Model), 4.6 (Rectifier Circuits)

    III. MOSFETs, particularly from Section 5.1. (Device Structure), 5.2 (Current-Voltage Characteristics),  5.3 (MOSFET Circuits at DC)

Please note that these sections are referred from the 8th Edition of the textbook (I will try to post some relevant materials on OnQ in a folder called Midterm).
