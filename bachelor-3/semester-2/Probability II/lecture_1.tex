	\section{Part 1: Multiple Random Variables}
	2020-01-06 

	$S$ is the underlying sample space of a random variable. We can define a probability measure $P$ on $S$, which takes these events to number between 0 and 1, ie its probability. $P$ is defined on all "reasonable, well-behaved" subsets of S. 

	\[
		P : \text{"reasonable" subset of S} \to  [0, 1]
	.\]
